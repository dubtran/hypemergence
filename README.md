HypeMergence
======================

###Final project for Zipfian Academy: predicting emerging artists from HypeM's Latest Blogged Artists
--------------------------------------
~ An attempt to check out *emerging* musicians that are currently being blogged about

HypeMergence is a web app that collects artists from [Hypem's Latest Blogged](http://hypem.com/latest/noremix) and their data from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com/) and [Next Big Sound](https://www.nextbigsound.com/). It runs some "magic" or rather *analytics* on the data collected to then show you if the artist will be emerging or not. 

Artists are ranked, from left to right, according to their probablity of being an emerging artist

Emerging artists are labeled in yellow, whereas artists in white are unfortunately not so much.
