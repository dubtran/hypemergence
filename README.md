HypeMergence
======================

###Final project for Zipfian Academy: predicting emerging artists from HypeM's Latest Blogged Artists
--------------------------------------
~ An attempt to check out *emerging* musicians that are currently being blogged about

HypeMergence is a web app that collects artists from [Hypem's Latest Blogged](http://hypem.com/latest/noremix) and their data from [Echonest](http://the.echonest.com/) and [Next Big Sound](https://www.nextbigsound.com/). It runs some "magic" or rather *analytics* on the data collected to then show you if the artist will be emerging or not. 

Emerging artists are labeled in yellow, whereas artists in white are unfortunately not so much.
